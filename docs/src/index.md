# LiveServer.jl - Documentation

LiveServer is a simple and lightweight development web-server written in Julia, based on [HTTP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl).
It has live-reload capability, i.e. when changing files, every browser (tab) currently displaying a corresponding page is automatically refreshed.

LiveServer is inspired from Python's [`http.server`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) and Node's [`browsersync`](https://www.browsersync.io/).

## Installation

The package is currently un-registered.
In Julia ≥ 1.0, you can add it using the Package Manager writing

```
(v1.2) pkg> add https://github.com/asprionj/LiveServer.jl
```

## Usage

The main function `LiveServer` exports is [`serve`](@ref) which starts listening to the current folder and makes its content available to a browser.
The following code creates an example directory and serves it:

```julia-repl
julia> using LiveServer
julia> LiveServer.example() # creates an "example/" folder with some files
julia> cd("example")
julia> serve() # starts the local server & the file watching
✓ LiveServer listening on http://localhost:8000...
  (use CTRL+C to shut down)
```

Open a Browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/` to see the content being rendered; try modifying files (such as `index.html`) and watch the changes being rendered immediately in the browser.

### Serve docs

A derived function from `serve` that will be convenient to Julia package developpers is `servedocs` which runs `Documenter` along with `LiveServer` to render your docs and will track and render any modifications to your docs.
This can make docs development significantly easier.

Assuming you are in `directory/to/YourPackage.jl` and that you have a `docs/` folder as prescribed by [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl), just run:

```julia
julia> using LiveServer
julia> servedocs()
[ Info: SetupBuildDirectory: setting up build directory.
[ Info: ExpandTemplates: expanding markdown templates.
...
└ Deploying: ✘
✓ LiveServer listening on http://localhost:8000/ ...
  (use CTRL+C to shut down)
```

Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/` to see your docs being rendered; try modifying files (e.g. `docs/index.md`) and watch the changes being rendered in the browser.


## How it works

Let's assume you have a directory similar to that generated by [`LiveServer.example()`](@ref):

```
.
├── css
│   └── master.css
├── files
│   └── TestImage.png
├── index.html
└── pages
    └── blah.html
```

After launching `serve()` in that directory, you can visit the rendered website by navigating to the page `http://localhost:8000/`.
This initiates a GET request from the browser which is caught by a listener loop in LiveServer.
The requested file (here `index.html`) is then sent to the client after injection of a small script which can trigger a reload of the page upon receiving a signal.

If you now modify the page `index.html`, LiveServer will detect that the file has been modified and send a signal to the client which will cause the small script to trigger a page reload.
